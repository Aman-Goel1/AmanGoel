Hi! I am in my final semester of B.Tech CSE (Honors) program at IIIT, Hyderabad. I am interested in scalable physics augmented machine learning for computer vision, graphics and machine learning. 

I am currently a visting scholar at the University of Glasgow, advised by Prof. Edmond S.L. Ho.

Prior to this I was a visiting scholar at Northumbria University, advised by Prof. Edmond S.L. Ho.

I spent my undergraduate honors research with Prof. Avinash Sharma at The Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), a premier computer vision and graphics research lab in India.

I am always looking for new research opportunity, please contact me if you are looking for an academic collaboration.
